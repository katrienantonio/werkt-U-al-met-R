A 3h introductory workshop: learning R by doing, oriented to actuaries
and risk managers\!

Course materials for the online edition of the course in September 2021.

The R programming language is an invaluable tool for data science. This
course equips you with the fundamental tools for data analysis in R and
RStudio.

üìÜ September 6, 2021 <br> üïì From 9.00am to 12.00pm <br> üìç online,
organized by Capgemini Academy and Nationale Nederlanden

Course materials will be posted in the days before the workshop.

## Learning outcomes

You‚Äôll come out of this course with basic understanding of R as an
environment for data handling, data exploration and data visualization.
Via a set of hands-on demonstrations and exercises you first study the
**basics of the R syntax**, you will explore RStudio as an integrated
development environment for R programming and learn about **R
packages**. You explore the **different types of objects**, **data
structures and data types** used in R. Then, you focus on **working with
data sets** in R; import, export, data manipulations, data cleaning and
wrangling. You will meet powerful packages such as data.table and the
packages from the tidyverse. Finally, you will use R to create various
types of insightful **graphics** and discover the **basics of writing
and using functions** in R.

The course is designed for new R users, no prior knowledge is required.

## Schedule and Course Material

The detailed schedule is subject to small changes. Lecture material will
be added in the days before the workshop.

## Software Requirements

You have **two options** to join the coding exercises covered during the
workshop. Either you join the RStudio cloud workspace dedicated to the
workshop, and then you‚Äôll run R in the cloud, from your browser. Or you
use your local installation of R and RStudio.

We kindly ask participants to **join the RStudio Cloud as default**\!

### RStudio Cloud - default\!

You will join our workspace on R Studio Cloud. This enables a **very
accessible set-up** for working with R in the cloud for the less
experienced user\!

<https://rstudio.cloud/spaces/143507/join?access_code=j%2FGjLwr6Pwix9FucSdDT3Q3XIbZARdRt8aii7ttZ>

Here are the steps you should take (before the workshop):

  - visit the above link
  - log in by creating an account for RStudio Cloud or by using your
    Google or GitHub login credentials
  - join the space
  - at the top of your screen you see ‚ÄòProjects‚Äô, click ‚ÄòProjects‚Äô
  - with the ‚Äòcopy‚Äô button (on the right) you can make your own version
    of the ‚Äòlearn R by doing‚Äô project; in this copy you can work on the
    exercises, add comments etc.
  - you should now be able to visit the ‚Äòlearn R by doing‚Äô project and
    see the ‚Äòscripts‚Äô and ‚Äòdata‚Äô folders on the right. Open and run the
    ‚Äòinstallation-instructions.R‚Äô script from the scripts folder, to
    see if everything works fine.

We will have everything set up for you in the correct way. You only have
to login\!

### Local installation - optional (make sure you have access to the RStudio Cloud as sketched above)\!

Alternatively, you can bring a laptop with a recent version of R and
RStudio installed. Make sure you can connect your laptop to the internet
(or download the course material one day before the start of the
workshop). You will need:

  - R (at least 3.5.2 <https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/>)
  - RStudio
    (<https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download>)

In the `prework` folder you will find a step-by-step guide to installing
R and RStudio (though a bit outdated).

Please run the following script in your R session to install the
required packages

``` r
packages <- c("tidyverse", "here", "rstudioapi", "MASS", "actuar", "lubridate", "readr", "readxl", "haven")

new_packages <- packages[!(packages %in% installed.packages()[,"Package"])]
if(length(new_packages)) install.packages(new_packages)

if(sum(!(packages %in% installed.packages()[, "Package"]))) {
  stop(paste('The following required packages are not installed:\n', 
             paste(packages[which(!(packages %in% installed.packages()[, "Package"]))], collapse = ', ')));
} else {
  message("Everything is set up correctly. You are ready to go.")
}
```

These instructions can also be downloaded as .R script from the
`scripts` folder. Open this script in RStudio (via File \> Open file),
select the code and press the Run button top right in the script window.
